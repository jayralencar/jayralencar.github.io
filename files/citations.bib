abstract = {The authoring of meaningful sentences is an essential requirement for AAC systems aimed at the education of children with complex communication needs. Some studies propose the use of linguistic knowledge databases to meet that requirement. In this paper, we propose and present a Semantic Grammar (SG) for AAC systems based on visual and semantic clues. The proposed SG was acquired using an automatic process based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the extraction of semantic relations from text samples. We assessed the SG precision on suggesting the correct words on reconstructing telegraphic sentences and obtained a precision average of 90{\%}.},

abstract = {Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) boards are essential tools for people with Complex Communication Needs (e.g., a person with down’s syndrome, autism, or cerebral palsy). These boards allow the construction of messages by arranging pictograms in sequence. In this context, a pictogram is a picture with a label that denotes an action, object, person, animal, or place. Predicting the next pictogram to be set in a sentence in construction is an essential feature for AAC boards to facilitate communication. Previous work in this task used n-gram statistical language models and knowledge bases. However, neural network literature suggests they can cope better with the task, and transformers-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) are revolutionizing this field. In this paper, we present PictoBERT, an adaptation of BERT for the next pictogram prediction task. We changed the BERT’s input embeddings to allow word-sense usage instead of words, considering that a word-sense represents a pictogram better than a simple word. The proposed model outperforms the n-gram models and knowledge bases. Besides, PictoBERT can be fine-tuned to adapt to different users’ needs, making transfer learning its main characteristic.}

abstract = {Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems assist individuals with complex communication needs, allowing them to construct sentences by selecting communication cards. The facilitation of sentence construction primarily entails enabling efficient communication card selection. An approach to this involves using language models for communication card prediction. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the AAC population poses unique challenges due to diverse vocabulary needs, suggesting one-size-fits-all approaches may be insufficient. This study introduces PrAACT, a method that leverages large, transformer-based language models, such as BERT, for communication card prediction. This method focuses on easy adaptability to incorporate user-specific vocabularies into the model. The method involves adapting a text corpus to the AAC domain, fine-tuning a transformer-based language model, and replacing the language model weights with an encoded representation of the user’s vocabulary. We conducted an assessment of PrAACT under both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. The performance of the models produced using PrAACT was superior to those pre-trained for the task. In addition, the main advantage of PrAACT is that it allows to quickly adapt a transformer-based language model to communication card prediction according to the user’s vocabulary.}

The system automates various stages of case analysis, including basic information extraction, admissibility examination, Periculum in mora and Fumus boni iuris analyses, and recommendations generation. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate INACIA’s potential in extracting relevant information from case documents, evaluating its legal plausibility, and formulating propositions for judicial decision-making. Utilizing a validation dataset alongside LLMs, our evaluation methodology presents a novel approach to assessing system performance, correlating highly with human judgment. These results underscore INACIA’s potential in complex legal task handling while also acknowledging the current limitations. This study discusses possible improvements and the broader implications of applying AI in legal contexts, suggesting that INACIA represents a significant step towards integrating AI in legal systems globally, albeit with cautious optimism grounded in the empirical findings.},
