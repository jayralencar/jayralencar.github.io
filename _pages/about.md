## Introduction

I am a Professor at the [Universidade Federal do Cariri](https://www.ufca.edu.br/portal/), Brazil, and a collaborator researcher at the [Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/). I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/), Brazil. My primary focus is on Assistive Technologies, with a specialization in employing deep learning techniques to enhance sentence construction within augmentative and alternative communication systems. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks, including information retrieval, information extraction, question answering and text summarization.


## Research Interests
My passion lies at the intersection of AI and Assistive Technologies, where I concentrate on leveraging deep learning methodologies to facilitate sentence construction within augmentative and alternative communication systems. Through my research, I aim to develop innovative approaches that empower individuals with disabilities to communicate more effortlessly and efficiently. Furthermore, I have made significant contributions to the field by proposing [Visconde](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-28238-6_44), one of the pioneering approaches for incorporating information retrieval in LLMs.
