<!-- Jayr A. Pereira is an AI researcher and PhD student with a strong passion for natural language processing. With years of experience in the field, Jayr has developed a deep understanding of the complex mechanisms behind language, and how they can be used to build intelligent systems that can understand and interpret text in a variety of languages, including English and Brazilian Portuguese. -->



## Introduction
I am a PhD student at the Centro de Inform√°tica of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, in Brazil. I work as a Artificial Intelligence researcher at [NeuralMind.ai](neuralmind.ai). My research topic is related to Assistive Technologies. In my PhD, I am applying deep learning techniques for facilitating sentence construction in augmentative and alternative communication systems. 

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of AI and Assistive Technologies. Specifically, I am interested in using deep learning techniques to facilitate sentence construction in augmentative and alternative communication systems. Through my research, I hope to develop new approaches that can help individuals with disabilities to communicate more easily and effectively.

## Expertise
My expertise lies in the following areas:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Natural Language Processing
* Deep Learning
* Augmentative and Alternative Communication
* Information Retrieval

## Languages
* Portuguese
* English
* Spanish
